## Ancient Thai Capital
Sokothai was an incredible joy to visit, if only for a day. The city is composed of a central 'inner city' area which consists of a national park and several historic temples and structures. We were able to see all of the popular sights in Sokothai in one day, choosing to use a motorbike rather than the traditional bycicle mode of transport used by tourists in the area.

The most notable experience besides the sights has to be the food! The 'Sokothai special noodle' served in most roadside stands was a great combination of sweet and spicy. 

While the nightlife was sub-par, the experiences during the day more than made up for it. There are also a few specialty hotels that provide a relaxing environment to unwind after seeing the sights.

The history of this city is incredible, and was difficult to comprehend for someone who has not often left America and its 300-ish years of modern European history. While the city is not as frequently visited by tourists, it is worth the trip.
