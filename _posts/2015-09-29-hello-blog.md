##About Me
I've been interested in software development since the tail-end of my high school career. Since coming to RIT in Autumn of 2011, that interest has continually grown. I have spent time honing my skills at companies on the east and west coast, deploying code to millions of people at scale. In addition to web development, I have done web automation testing, developer operations, and simple microcontroller development.
Lately, I have become more and more interested in data-driven applications. I realized that maintaining simple web applications no longer prove to be challenging enough to hold my interest. Moving forward, I would like to pick up more projects with a focus on data management and analytics with simple to use and intuitive frontends. 

##School
I'm currently a student at RIT, studying with a major in Software Engineering and a minor in Computer Engineering with an expected graduation date of May 2016. 

My course projects have covered topics such as web application architecture and development, deploying scalable applications, critical thinking, and problem solving skills. By far the greatest advantage of the RIT Software Enginnering program has been the full year of coooperative education.
