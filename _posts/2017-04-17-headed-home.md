## Back to NY for the weekend

It's been awhile since I've been home to see family. Taking a trip back tends to put
things into perspective. Since settling into the new job, time has been passing considerably faster than
while in school. Hard to to think that it's almost been a year since graduation.

It's nice to take some time to reflect on what our family has accomplished over the
last year. With my sister graduating college in May (and my father returning to school!)
, it's tough to find time together as a family. Now that my sister and I are older
it is much easier to value what we have, and to appreciate our moments together.

While work is going very well, I'm finding it's easy to lose track of other
priorities. It was good to take some time to remind myself of that. I'm hoping to put
together some new content over the next few weeks related to non work goals I've set for myself.
A few friends and I are traveling to a couple cities in western Europe. I'm hoping that's a good
excuse to get back into writing here and there.
