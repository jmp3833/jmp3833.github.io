## A 192 Mile Ride to PTown
I recently signed up for the [2019 PMC](http://profile.pmc.org/JP0479), a bike ride generating charitable donations that go completely to the [Jimmy Fund](http://www.jimmyfund.org/about-us/about-the-jimmy-fund/). The fund promotes the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute here in Boston. All funds raised go completely to cancer research, primarily to seed funding for early stage studies. 

I'm really excited to begin training for the 192 mile, 2 day ride from Sturbridge to Provincetown. To bootstrap fundraising efforts, I'm beginning with a personal pledge of $500, and am hoping to contribute further before the ride begins on Augist 3rd. If you'd also like to contribute to an event that "raises more money for charity than any other single event in the country" you can do so [here](https://egifts.pmc.org/JP0479).

Hoping today's storm in Boston is the last of the season. Looks like it'll be another few weeks of indoor training though. Happy riding everyone!
