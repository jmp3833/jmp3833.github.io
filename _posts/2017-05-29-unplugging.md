## How Important is a Vacation?
Last week I returned from a 10 day trip to Spain and France. Would recommend! I've been looking forward
to getting some time away from work now that I've been out of school for exactly a year.
I've always been a crummy work/life balancer, even though
I seem to be getting the same amount done each week regardless of how much time I spend
working out of the office. The "work smarter, not harder" philosophy has been gaining
popularity, and I'm starting to realize why.

Traveling to Europe (for the first time!) was incredible. The perceived lack of urgency by most French and Spanish citizens
really stuck out to me. While we rushed through meals at the latest tourist spot, folks would look
pretty concerned, like we were trying to leave because we weren't having a good time.
As the trip went on, I realized the difference in behavior was in no way laziness, but instead a more deliberate enjoyment of
one's time. Growing up in the Northeast has always made me feel a sense of haste.
I know I need to take some more time for personal enjoyment rather than trying
to squeeze utility out of every minute. At the end of the day, I'm more productive
whenever I'm enjoying myself anyways.

Enjoying the day-to-day has a direct correlation with the quality of my work, relationships,
and overall well being. Every few months I tend to forget this, and end up putting in more hours while still
getting less quality work done. I've been a fan of yoga and guided meditation to help break myself
out of this cycle. I feel at ease and effective when I start my day with some mindfulness.
That being said, some time away has been the best way for me to get back on track.

Hopefully everyone is taking some time to reset as we transition into Summer!
